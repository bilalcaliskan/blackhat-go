DESIGNING THE PROJECT STRUCTURE:
When building an API client, you should structure it so that the function calls and logic stand alone. This
allows you to reuse the implementation as a library in other projects. That way, you won’t have to reinvent
the wheel in the future. Building for reusability slightly changes a project’s structure. For the Shodan
example, here’s the project structure:
    $ tree github.com/blackhat-go/bhg/ch-3/shodan
    github.com/blackhat-go/bhg/ch-3/shodan
        |---cmd
        |   |---shodan
        |       |---main.go
        |---shodan
            |---api.go
            |---host.go
            |---shodan.go
The main.go file defines package main and is used primarily as a consumer of the API you’ll build; in this case,
you use it primarily to interact with your client implementation.
The files in the shodan directory—api.go, host.go, and shodan.go—define package shodan, which contains the types
and functions necessary for communication to and from Shodan. This package will become your stand-alone library
that you can import into various projects.
