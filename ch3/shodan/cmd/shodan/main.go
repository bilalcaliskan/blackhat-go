		The Shodan URL is defined as a constant value in shodan/shodan.go, that way, you can easily access and reuse
		it within your implementing functions. If Shodan ever changes the URL of its API, youâ€™ll have to make the
		change at only this one location in order to correct your entire codebase. Next, you define a Client struct,
		used for maintaining your API token across requests. Finally, the code defines a New() helper function, taking
		the API token as input and creating and returning an initialized Client instance.
